# pands-project

This repository contains the project for the Programming and Scripting module of the Higher Diploma in Data Analytics from ATU.\
This project involves researching Fisher's Iris data set and analysing it using Python.

This file will firstly give some background information to the dataset in question. 

I will then outline the steps which I needed to take before I could begin the actual analysis itself: this includes importing the libraries which I will use for the project; giving a description of these libraries; and the details of how my final python script will print out a summary of each variable to a single text file.

Finally I will give details of my analysis of the data set
* I will discuss the histograms I generated from the data,
* Followed by the scatterplots of each pair of variables,
* Finally, I will  discuss any additional analyses I have carried out on the dataset.

My project will conclude with a summary of my findings, and my thoughts upon conclusion of the project. \
I will also provide a list of references which I used to complete my work.

## Background

The data set concerns three species of the Iris flowering plant genus: Iris setosa, Iris virginica, and Iris versicolor. \
Fifty data points were measured for each species (one hundred and fifty data points in total), and these data points related to four features of the flower: sepal length, sepal width, petal length and petal width. 

The petal of a flowering plant are the leaves of the flower which surround the reproductive parts of the flower, and which are often brightly coloured to attract pollinators [1]. Sepals usually protect the flower when it is in a bud and structurally support the petals when the flower is in bloom. [2]

The below is an image of the three flowers analysed in the dataset, along with a label for the sepal and petal of one of the three flower species (Iris Versicolor):
