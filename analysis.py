# The below section of this script generates the histograms for the project.
# sns.set() imposes one of five general themes on to the histograms.
# sns.displot creates each histogram: here we pass in the Dataframe, df, which we will generate the histogram from,
# specify the column to be analysed (eg. 'sepal length'), and select the number of bins for the histogram.
# I used the 'hue' argument to cause the data in the histogram to be coloured according to what variety of Iris flower
# the data relates to, and a legend is automatically created. 
# This allows us to compare the distribution of each trait for each variety of Iris flower.
# The 'stack' argument causes the data to overlap in a stacked fashion, rather than layering them over each other transparently,
# which I think makes it harder to compare the data.
# I experimented with different Seaborn palettes and decided upon the reversed form of the 'Set1' palette, as I find the 
# combination of colours attractive and earthy, which is appropriate for a data analysis project about Iris flowers! 
# They also contrast enough to make it easy to know which data is sourced from which Iris variety.
