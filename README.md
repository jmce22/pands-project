# pands-project

This repository contains the project for the Programming and Scripting module of the Higher Diploma in Data Analytics from ATU.\
This project involves researching Fisher's Iris data set and analysing it using Python.

This project will firstly give some background information to the dataset in question. I will then carry out the following analyses on the dataset:
1. Output a summary of each variable to a single text file,
2. Save a histogram of each variable to png files, and
3. Output a scatter plot of each pair of variables.
4. I will carry out additional analyses of my choice.

The data set concerns three species of the Iris flowering plant genus: Iris setosa, Iris virginica, and Iris versicolor. \
Fifty data points were measured for each species (one hundred and fifty data points in total), and these data points related to four features of the flower: sepal length, sepal width, petal length and petal width.
