# pands-project

This repository contains the project for the Programming and Scripting module of the Higher Diploma in Data Analytics from ATU.\
This project involves researching Fisher's Iris data set and analysing it using Python.

This project will firstly give some background information to the dataset in question. I will then carry out the following analyses on the dataset:
1. Outputs a summary of each variable to a single text file,
2. Saves a histogram of each variable to png files, and
3. Output a scatter plot of each pair of variables.

4. I will carry out additional analyses of my choice.

The data set concerns three species of the Iris flowering plant genus: Iris setosa, Iris virginica, and Iris versicolor. \
Fifty data points were measured for each species (one hundred and fifty data points in total), and these data points related to four features of the flower: sepal length, sepal width, petal length and petal width.

## Background

The petal of a flowering plant are the leaves of the flower which that surround the reproductive parts of the flower, and which are often brightly coloured to attract pollinators [1]. Sepals usually protect the flower when it is in a bud and structurally support the petals when the flower is in bloom. [2]

The below is an image of the three flowers analysed in the dataset, along with a label for the sepal and petal of one of the three flower species (Iris Versicolor):
